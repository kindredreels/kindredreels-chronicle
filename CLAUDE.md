# Kindred Reels Chronicle

## What This Is

An analytics and storytelling tool for the Kindred Reels project — a collaborative platform for creating cinematic video memories from family photos and voice recordings. Kindred Reels is a 100K+ line production web app built entirely through AI-assisted development (Claude Code), and this repo tells that story both quantitatively and qualitatively.

This repo was bootstrapped from the `code-chronicle/` tool that previously lived inside the Kindred Reels codebase. It's being expanded into a full React application with multiple views.

## What Kindred Reels Is (for context)

Kindred Reels (kindredreels.com) lets families create cinematic tribute videos by:
- Uploading photos with AI-powered curation (Gemini for analysis, Rekognition for face detection)
- Inviting family members to record voice memories for photos
- Generating professional videos with Ken Burns effects, beat-synced music, and themed slides

Tech stack: React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Lambda backend, Python video processing on EC2, DynamoDB, S3, various AI services. The entire codebase was written through Claude Code without the founder writing code directly.

## Repo Structure

- `scripts/` — Data collection and processing scripts
- `data/` — Generated data files (snapshots, PR entries, phases)
- `src/` — React application (being built)
- `dashboard/` — Legacy vanilla JS dashboard (to be replaced by React app, then removed)
- `output/` — Generated documents

## Key Context

- The Kindred Reels repo is private on GitHub. Use `gh` CLI for PR access.
- The Kindred Reels repo may be available locally — check environment or ask.
- Code stats collection script needs a path to the Kindred Reels repo to count lines.
- PR commit messages are extremely detailed (generated by Claude Code) and are often richer than PR descriptions.

## Commands

```bash
npm run collect          # Collect code stats from Kindred Reels repo
npm run dev              # Start React dev server
npm run build            # Build for production
```
